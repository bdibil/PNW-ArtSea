                   <p>Welcome ArtSea Fan!  Here in Seattle, Art is like Rain in Forks, Wa...always there! So we developed an app that connects you, the User, to local Artists.</p>

                    <p>Why the name ArtSea? Because we wanted to kick this app off right. Starting with state of the Art,ART and Artists. Hence - Art-Seattle or "ArtSea"</p>

                    <p> Let's get started. Create an account. Then you will be able to view local artists, art-pieces and you can like your favorites.</p>
                    <p>If you are an ARTIST, create your account, and then upload images of YOUR work. It's that easy!</p>

                    <p> Just like that we have united millions of "ArtLovers" with "Artists"!</p>

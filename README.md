# ArtSea <ArtSea>
  
## Description  
- The purpose of this app is to create an online environment for "ArtLovers" to connect "TO LOCAl ARTIST". You can go online and view art anywhere. But here at ArtSea we want to bring our community together. Keep that $ local so that both ArtLover and Artist can continuously enjoy the Benefit!
- It was built using the MVC paradigm: "Model" responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the "Controller." "View" means the presentation of the model in a particular format. "Controller" responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data "Model" objects.

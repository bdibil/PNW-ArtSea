# ArtSea
The purpose of this app is to create an online environment for "ArtLovers" to connect "TO LOCAl ARTIST". You can go online and view art anywhere. But here at ArtSea we want to bring our community together. Keep that $ local so that both ArtLover and Artist can continously enjoy the Benefit! 

## Acceptance Criteria

- Must have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm:
  "Model" is responsible for managing the "data" of the application. It receives user input from the "controller."
  "View" means the presentation of the model in a particular format.
  "Controller" responds to the user input and performs interactions on the Data "model" objects. The "controller" receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model through Router.
          (realistacally- this should be called an MVC(R) with R being the unsung hero. As Router does all the labor and the MVC get all the glory. Sound familar!?!)

- Must include authentication (sessions and cookies) 
 
- Must utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
        CLOUDINARY
        nodeMailerAPI

- Must have a front end/UI utilizing Handlebars 

- Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
     (FULL CRUD APP)

- Must be deployed using Heroku 
      (with data)

- Must use a Node and Express web server

- Must be backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM

- Must Protect API keys in Node Environment variables
        (safely tucked away inside the .env)
